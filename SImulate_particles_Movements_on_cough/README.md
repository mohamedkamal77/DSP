>
> 1. **We got centerline Velocity as function of distance From jet equation (12) in this study.**

> 2. **From previous equation we got distance in time by solving differential equation.**

> 3. **We could get the constant c by putting s= 6.8 do and get t from U(s)  at s < 6.8 do then substitute and get c .**
>
> 4. **As for getting velocity through time at any point clicked we used equation (17).**
>
> 	- **From equation(17) the decay process of average velocity is the curve exp(-t/t*) , we got (t*) from equation(18).**
>
> 	- **Assuming the velocity at any point go through the same process so we got U(t,s)=U(s)*exp(-t/t*),U(s) of eq(12).**

> 5. **The trajectory , most of the models assumed that cough partticle travel in cone-shaped trajectory .**
>
> 6. **The velocity away from center ,the velocity at any section follows a Gaussian function so we got gaussian function from this [model](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02786826.2014.968655#f0006).**
>
> 7. **Face masks reduce the distance cough travel , if it was lossy the particle will travel with very large angle.**
